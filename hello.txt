“I've... seen things you people wouldn't believe... [contemptuous laugh] Attack ships on fire
 off the shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. 
 All those... moments... will be lost in time, like [small cough] tears... in... rain. 
 Time... to die...”
我见过你们人类无法相信的事物，战舰在猎户悬臂边缘熊熊燃烧，我曾看到C射线照亮唐怀瑟之门
附近黑暗的空间，所有这些时刻终将流失在时光中，一如眼泪融入雨中，死亡之时已到
